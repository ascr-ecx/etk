The Evalution ToolKit is designed to automate image-based perceptual experiments.  Developed under a DOE grant by the ECX Collaboration, this 
software is targeted at researchers in visualization. 
The software modules work within Qualtrics survey software.  Each module consists of three scripts: a JavaScript, a CSS file and an HTML file
that are added to a Qualtrics project/question.  The researcher needs to minimally edit the code (e.g. changing the list of images and
modifying some sizes to fit the images under study) to create a basic psychophysical experiment.  Any necessary randomization is automatically 
done.
