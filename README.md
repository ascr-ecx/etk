The Evalution ToolKit is designed to automate image-based perceptual experiments.  Developed under a DOE grant by the ECX Collaboration, this software is targeted at researchers in scientific visualization. 

The software modules work within Qualtrics survey software.  Each module consists of three scripts: a JavaScript, a CSS file and an HTML file that are added to a Qualtrics project/question.  The researcher needs to minimally edit the code (e.g. changing the list of images and modifying some sizes to fit the images under study) to create a basic psychophysical experiment.  Any necessary image randomization is automatically done within the JavaScript.  

Please see the EvaluationToolKitREADME for more details on using the ETK. The ETK-Checklist.docx file provides a useful checklist of steps needed to implement an ETK module.
