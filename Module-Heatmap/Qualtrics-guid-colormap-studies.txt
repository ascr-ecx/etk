Preprocessing data procedure:

1.	Upload images to Qualtrics graphics library in the designated folders
2.	Go to account settings→Qualtrics IDs→libraries: My Library: Ayat Mohammed
3.	Navigate until you find your folder name then select starting with folder name until you select all images and their ids
4.	Copy and past in excel sheet, delete any header and any unwanted  data
5.	Save as windows csv format
6.	In the python file “File-names_list.py” feed in the .csv file name and run the code to get a list of images names 
7.	Insert this list in Qualtrics question’ javascript code for “var baseNames ” 
	
Post-processing data procedure:

1.	Copy images names from the graphic library fro Qualtrics and save them as two columns one for the ID and one for the original name then save as csv file.
2.	Export a csv file of responses from Qualtrics. Clean the file from the metadata, demographics, timing, and the “ImgInd” and “AMT number” columns. So there will be a csv file with the responses starting with the training response.
3.	The columns named “n0, n1, ... nn” should be cleaned, so this pattern “https://utexas.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM= “ should be deleted from all images names in this file using the find and replace tool in MS Excel.
4.	Use the two files as input for the python script “response-cleaning”
